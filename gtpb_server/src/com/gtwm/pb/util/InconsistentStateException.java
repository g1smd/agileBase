/**
 * This exception should be thrown if the application is left in an inconsistent state needing a restart to
 * sort out. This can happen if the relational database and in-memory objects get out of sync for any reason.
 * For example, when adding a field to a record, the code adds the field object to the record object, then
 * performs the necessary SQL. If the SQL fails, it tries to remove the field object from the record object
 * but if this fails as well, then the app is in an inconsistent state.
