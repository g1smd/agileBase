/**
 * INNER, LEFT_OUTER, RIGHT_OUTER and FULL_OUTER are the standard SQL join types.
 *
 * NONE means don't do 'table 1 join table 2 on condition', but just 'table 1, table 2'. This has the effect
 * of including data in each row of table 2 for every row of table 1. e.g. if table 1 has 10 rows and table 2
 * 2, the join will result in 20 rows. This 'cross product' type of join is useful to use when table 2 has only one row. You
 * can include constants in calculations without having to hard code them. For example, table 2 could contain
 * a pay rate to be changed annually.
 *
 * If NONE is used, the left table and field and right field are ignored, the only relevant part of the join
 * data is the right report or table
