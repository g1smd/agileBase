GT portalBase programming information and practices:

*) Interfaces should be defined for all classes prior to implementing them apart from those in:
com.gtwm.pb.util most of which contain only static methods
com.gtwm.pb.servlets which extend HttpServlet or VelocityServlet, or contain static methods

*) Each class that needs to log debug or error information should use it's own logger
defined with a private variable in this manner:
private static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class.getName())
Output will then be written in {Servlet container root}/logs/ into file portalbase.xxx.log

*) Exceptions: For exceptions caused by user input, particularly SQLExceptions, catch them as soon as possible
and generate a user friendly message to pass to the user interface for display in the appropriate way. 
For any other exception, either let ManageController catch it and throw a ServletException with the original exception
as the root cause or do whatever looks best for the situation

*) For release, all severe exceptions should log to file

*) Comment liberally! Javadoc interfaces

*) import statements are almost always explicit - no wildcard imports;

*) Don't use setters unless absolutely necessary - rather use constructors to populate objects with data

*) For questions, http://www.javapractices.com/ or oliver@agilebase.co.uk

*) Unit testing: THERE ARE CURRENTLY ONLY A FEW UNIT TESTS, this is a drawback. Additions welcome

*) Database persistence: Hibernate is used for schema objects

*) MVC:
controller = com.gtwm.pb.servlets.AppController
view = Velocity templates in WEB-INF/templates
model = DatabaseInfo is the base model interface

*) Guide to main classes
Tier 1: AppController, as above is the servlet that handles posted data to perform actions
Tier 2: It parcels out work to other classes in the com.gtwm.pb.servlets package as appropriate
- ServletAuthMethods: authentication related, e.g. adding/removing users and roles, assigning privileges
- ServletDataMethods: to do with database data (creating/deleting records etc.) and session data
- ServletSchemaMethods: e.g. editing table, field and report structures.
Tier 2 wraps actions in transactions (Hibernate and/or SQL) and handles commit/rollback
Tier 3 and below: other classes called by tier 2 as appropriate.
Largely manageSchema.DatabaseDefn and manageData.DataManagement
