## Used to get the display value of a relation - this is the value that should be set on the screen when the picker returns, having picked a row
#set($table = $sessionData.getTable())
## The relation field
#set($pickerField = $sessionData.getCustomField('picker_field'))
#set($pickerValue = $sessionData.getCustomString('picker_value'))

##TODO: when relating to another relation. this doesn't work
##Check it out

#set($displayField = $pickerField.getDisplayField())
#if($displayField.equals($displayField.getTableContainingField().getPrimaryKey()))
  #set($displayValue = $pickerField.getDisplayValue($pickerValue))##
#else
  #set($displayValue = $pickerValue)##
#end
$displayValue
